Hi I'm Alain - I'll be joining a coding bootcamp in Berlin, starting Jan'2021, for 3 months.  I'm passionate about learning abstract concepts and making them my own, before passing practiced knowledge onto others in a simpler form, so that they can succeed.

Beginner level in Javascript and JQuery.
