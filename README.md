Hi I'm Alain - I consider myself as a lifelong learner, I guess that's why I've moved into Tech.  I enjoy breaking down abstract concepts into simple tiny bits, in order to help others succeed.

Here are some of the tech stack I work with: Typescript, Redux, Node.js, Express, GraphQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, React and Nest.
